# Docking curation with streamlit and py3dmol

see [the app](https://share.streamlit.io/ljmartin/dockviz/main/stApp.py)
see [intro post](https://ljmartin.github.io/sideprojects/dockviz.html) for motivation.

## blurb:
This is a streamlit app to visualize docking hits for the purposes of manual curation before moving to _in vitro_ testing. You might use this to prioritize a ranked list of docking hits so that you only spend money on buying the ligands with the best chance of successfully binding the target.
